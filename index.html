 <h2>[Tyreque Davis]</h2>
 <p>[I am Tyreque Davis, a student at the University of the West Indies, Five Islands Campus, 
    with a keen interest in Web Development. I enjoy combining creativity and problem-solving
    to build websites that are both functional and visually appealing. Learning how to create
    interactive webpages excites me because it allows me to bring ideas to life while improving
    my programming and design skills. My goal is to continuously grow as a developer and explore
    new technologies to make meaningful digital experiences.]</p>
